<h3>NORTH AMERICAN RIVER OTTER</h3>
<p>A Characteristic of amphibious mammals is the thick and lustrous pelage.The underfur is short, dense and soft, intermixed with long guard hairs which are a glossy dark brown, usually paler on the underparts. The long vibrissae (tactile hairs) and the throat hairs are a silvery grey. The winter pelage is essentially the same as that of the summer. Well adapted to life in the water, the otter's body is long and streamlined from the bulbous nose pads to the long, tapered tail. The body is lithe and elongate as well as being solid and muscular. The comparatively small head is broad and distinctly flattened. The ears are small and may be closed underwater. The eyes are also small and somewhat anteriorly placed. The neck is scarcely narrower than the head and very muscular. The tail is also very thick and muscular and is about one-third the total length of the otter. It has short, powerful legs, the feet being large and broad with fully webbed toes. The claws are short. In adult otters, the male averages about 1% larger than the female in basic measurements and sometimes in mated pairs, the male may appear to be nearly one-third larger than a younger mate. The tail of the juvenile is relatively shorter than that of the adult, but the general appearance except for the size is similar.</p>
